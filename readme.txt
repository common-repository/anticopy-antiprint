Anticopy / Antiprint prevents users from copying or printing content. 

It is just a simple extension that add some CSS and JS that disable selection (copy) and print feature. 

Do not forget : totally prevent these features is <strong>not possible</strong>, if anyone really wants to get (steal) your content, it is possible, even with this extension enabled. It will just make it more complicated.
